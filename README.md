# Aces
Side project. Uses AVCapture to detect the type of ace in real time. Created with my own Machine Learning model. I hope to eventually have it recognize all 52 cards with above 70% confidence.


-AVCapture working. 
-Need to fix ML model. Falsely detecting Spades at 99% confidence.
-Need to implement way of detecting # of cards
